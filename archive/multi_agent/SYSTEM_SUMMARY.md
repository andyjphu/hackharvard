A sophisticated multi-file reasoning and acting agent system for autonomous UI automation using macOS accessibility APIs and Gemini 2.0 Flash.

## 🏗️ **Architecture Overview**

### **Core Components:**

1. **`agent_core.py`** - Main orchestration system

   - Perceive-Reason-Act loop
   - Agent state management
   - Autonomous operation control

2. **`perception.py`** - Environmental perception

   - UI element discovery (50+ elements per scan)
   - System state monitoring (battery, memory, CPU)
   - Context analysis

3. **`reasoning.py`** - Intelligent reasoning

   - Goal analysis using Gemini 2.0 Flash
   - Plan generation with confidence scores
   - Risk assessment and alternatives

4. **`action.py`** - Action execution

   - UI interactions (click, type, select, scroll)
   - System actions (brightness, background apps)
   - Error handling and retry logic

5. **`memory.py`** - Memory and learning
   - Experience storage and retrieval
   - Pattern recognition
   - Learning from past actions

## 🚀 **Key Features**

### **✅ Working Components:**

- **Perception**: Discovers 12+ UI elements per scan
- **Reasoning**: Gemini 2.0 Flash integration with high confidence
- **Action**: Multiple action types with error handling
- **Memory**: Stores and learns from experiences
- **Autonomous Operation**: Complete perceive-reason-act loop

### **🎯 Action Types Supported:**

- `click` - Click UI elements
- `type` - Type text into fields
- `select` - Select from dropdowns
- `scroll` - Scroll in directions
- `access_settings` - Open System Settings
- `enable_low_power_mode` - Toggle Low Power Mode
- `reduce_screen_brightness` - Adjust brightness
- `close_background_apps` - Close unnecessary apps
- `reason` - Planning actions

## 📊 **System Capabilities**

### **Perception Engine:**

- Scans interactive UI elements (buttons, fields, dropdowns)
- Monitors system state (battery, memory, CPU usage)
- Identifies constraints and limitations
- Context-aware analysis

### **Reasoning Engine:**

- **Gemini 2.0 Flash** for intelligent planning
- Goal-oriented analysis
- Risk assessment and mitigation
- Alternative strategy generation
- Confidence-based decision making

### **Action Engine:**

- Accessibility API integration
- Error recovery and retry logic
- Action validation
- System-level operations

### **Memory System:**

- Experience storage and retrieval
- Pattern recognition in success/failure
- Learning from past actions
- Long-term memory management

## 🔧 **Usage**

### **Basic Usage:**

```bash
# Run autonomous agent
python agent_core.py "optimize battery life" "System Settings"

# Test the system
python test_agent.py

# Test Gemini integration
python test_gemini_agent.py
```

### **Requirements:**

- macOS with accessibility permissions
- Gemini API key in `.env` file
- Python dependencies: `atomacos`, `psutil`, `google-generativeai`

## 🎯 **Example Use Cases**

### **Battery Optimization:**

## 🧠 **Intelligent Features**

### **Gemini Integration:**

- **Model**: Gemini 2.0 Flash
- **Capabilities**: Natural language understanding, planning, reasoning
- **Output**: Structured JSON plans with confidence scores
- **Fallback**: None - Gemini is required for intelligent operation

### **Learning System:**

- Stores all perceptions, reasonings, and actions
- Identifies patterns in successful/failed actions
- Learns from experience to improve performance
- Memory management with importance scoring

### **Error Handling:**

- Graceful degradation on perception errors
- Retry logic for failed actions
- Comprehensive error reporting
- Safe operation with system constraints
